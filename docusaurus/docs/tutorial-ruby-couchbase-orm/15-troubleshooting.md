# Troubleshooting

When working with CouchbaseOrm, you may encounter various issues or errors. In this section, we'll discuss common problems and provide troubleshooting tips to help you identify and resolve these issues effectively.

## 15.1. Common Issues

Here are some common issues you may encounter while using CouchbaseOrm:

1. **Connection Errors**: If you experience connection errors, such as "Failed to connect to Couchbase server," ensure that your Couchbase Server is running and accessible. Verify that the connection details in your configuration file are correct, including the hostname, port, bucket name, username, and password.

2. **Document Not Found**: If you receive a "Document not found" error when retrieving a document, double-check that the document ID is correct and exists in the Couchbase bucket. Make sure you haven't accidentally deleted or modified the document.

3. **N1QL Query Errors**: If your N1QL queries are not returning the expected results or throwing errors, check the syntax of your queries. Ensure that you are using the correct bucket name, index names, and attribute names. Verify that the appropriate indexes are created and available for the queried attributes.

4. **Validation Errors**: If you encounter validation errors when saving a document, review your model's validation rules and make sure the document attributes satisfy those rules. Check for presence, uniqueness, format, and other validation constraints.

5. **Unexpected Behavior**: If you experience unexpected behavior or results, double-check your code logic, query conditions, and attribute assignments. Ensure that you are using the correct methods, parameters, and data types.

## 15.2. Debugging Tips

When troubleshooting issues with CouchbaseOrm, consider the following debugging tips:

1. **Enable Logging**: CouchbaseOrm provides logging functionality to help you track the execution flow and identify issues. Enable logging in your application and set the log level to an appropriate verbosity. Review the log output for any error messages, stacktraces, or unexpected behavior.

2. **Inspect Couchbase Server**: Use the Couchbase Web Console or command-line tools to inspect your Couchbase Server instance. Check the bucket details, document contents, and index definitions to ensure they align with your application's expectations.

3. **Use Debugging Tools**: Utilize debugging tools like `byebug` or `pry` to pause the execution of your code at specific points and inspect variable values, object states, and method invocations. Set breakpoints in your code to step through the execution flow and identify the source of the issue.

4. **Test in Isolation**: Isolate the problematic code or query and test it in a separate environment or script. This allows you to focus on the specific issue without the complexity of the entire application. Create a minimal reproducible example that demonstrates the problem.

5. **Verify Couchbase Server Version**: Ensure that you are using a compatible version of Couchbase Server with CouchbaseOrm. Check the CouchbaseOrm documentation for version compatibility and make sure your server version meets the requirements.

6. **Consult Documentation and Community**: Refer to the CouchbaseOrm documentation, API reference, and guides for detailed information on how to use specific features and resolve common issues. Engage with the CouchbaseOrm community through forums, chat channels, or mailing lists to seek assistance from experienced users and developers.

7. **Reproduce and Report**: If you encounter a bug or an issue that seems to be related to CouchbaseOrm itself, try to reproduce the problem in a isolated environment. If the issue persists, consider reporting it to the CouchbaseOrm maintainers or filing an issue on the project's issue tracker, providing detailed information about the problem, steps to reproduce it, and any relevant code snippets or error messages.

Remember, troubleshooting is an iterative process. Start by isolating the problem, gathering relevant information, and systematically eliminating possible causes. Break down the issue into smaller components and test each component independently to narrow down the root cause.

If you are unable to resolve the issue on your own, don't hesitate to seek help from the CouchbaseOrm community or reach out to the project maintainers for assistance. Providing clear and detailed information about the problem, along with any relevant code snippets and error messages, will help others understand and provide more accurate guidance.

By following these troubleshooting tips and leveraging the available resources, you can effectively diagnose and resolve issues encountered while working with CouchbaseOrm.
